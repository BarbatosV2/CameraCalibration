README 

	This python file is to calibrate the camera. Every camera lens is curved and they are never flat.
	This code is to fix the curvature of the lens. 
	To calibrate the camera you will see another file.
	I downloaded the chessboard from https://markhedleyjones.com/projects/calibration-checkerboard-collection.

	Calibration method

	- Run the python code.
	- Put the printed chessboard paper on the flat surface.
	- For better calibration, face the camera 90 degree to the middle of the chess board
	- Press Q (it sometimes crash)
	- The new camera calibrated window will appear.
