	This python file is to calibrate the camera. Every camera lens is curved and they are never flat.
	This code is to fix the curvature of the lens. 
	To calibrate the camera you will see another file.
	I downloaded the chessboard from https://markhedleyjones.com/projects/calibration-checkerboard-collection.

	Calibration method

	- Run the python code.
	- Put the printed chessboard paper on the flat surface.
	- For better calibration, face the camera around 60 degree to the chess board
	- Press Q
	- In the terminal, you will find camera matrix and distortion coefficients matrix.
	- The new calibrated camera window will appear.
